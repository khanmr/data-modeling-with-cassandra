## Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra

### Summary

This project uses data from Sparkify, a music streaming app, and models user activity with an Apache Cassandra database and ETL pipeline using Python that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables. The goal is to help the analytics team identify the songs users are listening to.
